# Perimeter-calculator
The program you are given defines abstract class Figure and derives Rectangle and Triangle classes from it.
Add an abstract method Perimeter to class Figure, than override it in derived classes to calculate perimeters of already created Rectangle and Triangle objects.

Hint
Perimeter of rectangle with width w and height h => 2*w+2*h.
Perimeter of triangle with sides s1, s2, s3 => s1+s2+s3.

The abstract Perimeter method inside abstract Figure class should have no body.
